# Bug-Ventura-os-on-imac-2012
i had a problem on my imac 2012 - 13.2, where i installed macos 13.01 successfully.

But with OpenCore-patcher 0.51 then even 0.50 it does not install on Post-Install Menu - Graphics: Nvidia Kepler and - Graphics: Intel Ivy Bridge, I restart it but never install them.

Would you have any advice? Thanks in advance.
